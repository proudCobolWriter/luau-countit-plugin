<kbd>**Count it!**</kbd> was brought to light to give you a quick overview of your place by displaying statistics such as how much lines of code and scripts there are amid each service, how much duplicate scripts there are and even viruses, and all of that in a fancy GUI!

This plugin also allows you to keep track of how many lines and characters you have written in a day which is a pretty cool feature I believe!
